**Notable functionalities available in MERN DALL AI :**

1.	Image Generation from Text: DALL-E can generate images based on textual prompts or descriptions provided as input.
   
2.	Image Manipulation: Users can modify and manipulate generated images by altering attributes such as colors, shapes, sizes, and orientations. This allows for creative exploration and customization of the generated outputs.
   
3.	Contextual Understanding: DALL-E demonstrates an understanding of contextual relationships in the provided text prompt. It can generate images that align with the given context, incorporating spatial arrangements and object relationships to produce coherent visual outputs.
   
4.	Fine-Tuning and Transfer Learning: DALL-E's training allows for fine-tuning and transfer learning, enabling the adaptation of the model to specific domains or tasks. This allows users to leverage the model's capabilities for more specialized image generation applications.
   
5.	Posting: MERN DALL AI has additional new feature where the user can post their AI generated images into the community and can also explore the community showcase and posts of others.
